        Kids Mickey Mouse Laptop

    </span>
</h1>

    <p>
        I am Annapoorni, a middle school student, learning programming in Python.<br>
        My little sister, Vaishnavi loves to play with toys. One of these toys is a mickey mouse toy laptop. <br>
        This toy has different games like, <br>
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Order of Alphabets</li>
        <li>Make you own music </li>
        <li>Hungry snake</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        This laptop is engaging as well as educative. Everything is fine about this toy, everything except, the sound
        effect.
        Dare I say, all of us have experienced this before. The sound effects are the most irritating, irksome noises
        that ever existed.
        So, my dad and I decided to make a child-friendly laptop web app, that enables children to learn basic concepts.
        Also, it won't be very bothersome. This project will also help me to enhance my programming skills. <br>
        I can learn new languages for web development such as HTML, JavaScript and CSS.</p>
