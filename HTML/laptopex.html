    <h1 style="color:mediumpurple; font-family:verdana; text-align:center;">Kids Mickey Mouse Laptop</h1>
    <p style="color:salmon;text-align:center;font-family:verdana;font-size:larger;">I am Annapoorni, a middle school student who is learning programming in python.
    My little sister, Vaishnavi loves to play with toys. One of these toys is a mickey mouse toy laptop. This toy has many
different games like, Order of Alphabets, Make you own music, Hungry snake, etc. This laptop is engaging as well as educative.
Everything is fine about this toy, everything except, the sound effect. I daresay you have experienced this before. The sound
effects are the most irritating, irksome noises that ever existed. So, my dad and I decided to make a child-friendly laptop 
app / website that enables children to learn basic concepts. Also, it won't be very bothersome. This project will also help me to 
enhance my programming skills. I can learn new languages for web development such as HTML, JavaScript and CSS.</p>
